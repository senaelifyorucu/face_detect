**Face Recognition Project Using SQL Database and Python**


üî≠Welcome to my first AI project!
*This project is a face recognition project based on Python language and using SQL.*
There are three main Python files in my project, as you can find below;
*dataset_creater.py*

*trainer.py*

*detect.py*

These three files contain all the main variables of our project.

*While working on this project*
Do not forget to download modules such as cv2, facedetect, numpy to your device with the current version.
When my project starts running, it asks you for your ID, name and age information, turns on the video camera and you can see all the information you entered on the camera. Meanwhile, it takes 21 photos of you.
(The reason there are 21 is because I specified 20 + 1 in the dataset_creater.py file) It saves all of these photos to the dataset file.

The main AI point here is that your face is detected in the camera and your information is located under the live recognized face, good luck to everyone who wants to try it.ü§ù
